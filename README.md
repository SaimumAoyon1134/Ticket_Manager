## What is JSX?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allowst o write HTML-like code inside React components. It looks like HTML but has the full power of JavaScript.

## Why is JSX used?
- **Readable and Declarative:** Makes UI code easier to understand.
- **Efficient:** React transforms JSX into `React.createElement()` calls under the hood.
- **Dynamic:** You can embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX using `{}`.


```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```
